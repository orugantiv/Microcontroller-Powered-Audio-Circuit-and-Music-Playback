# Microcontroller-Powered Audio Circuit and Music Playback
## Project Description
Our project concept involves the creation of an audio amplification circuit designed using the microcontroller from project 7 as the basis. The primary function is to use sound files (music or just noise) passed into the microcontroller. This is then translated into electrical signals and then passed to the audio amplifier circuit, which should filter or amplify the electrical signal based on the user's input into 4 different switches. The resulting signal is then outputted to the user as audio via a speaker introduced into the circuit design.

## Required Components
The following components are required for this project:

- Speaker (Analog Discovery Kit 2)
- Capacitors
- Resistors
- Switches
- Op-Amps
- Microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico or Any Mbed Supported Microcontroller)
- Power supply (battery or external source)
## Project Objectives
### Our team aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Design and build the audio amplification circuit using the required components.
2. Write code to translate sound files into electrical signals that can be passed to the audio amplifier circuit.
3. Implement user input functionality to allow users to filter or amplify the electrical signal using switches.
4. Integrate the speaker into the circuit design and output the resulting audio signal.
5. Test and troubleshoot the circuit to ensure proper functionality.
## Installation and Usage
### For Raspberry Pi Pico with Thonny
To run the audio amplification circuit on a Raspberry Pi Pico, follow these steps:

1. Install Thonny on your computer and connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer via USB.
2. Open Thonny and create a new Python file.
3. Copy and paste the code from main.py into the Python file and save it.
4. Upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico by clicking on the "Run" button in Thonny.
5. Connect the required components to the Raspberry Pi Pico and turn on the power supply.
6. Play a sound file on your computer and listen to the output from the speaker.

### For mbed Devices on Arm Website
To run the audio amplification circuit on an mbed device, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on the Arm() website and log in.
2. Upload the song_demo folder to the website.
3. Connect the required components to the mbed device.
4. Run the code from the song_demo folder on the mbed device.
5. Play a sound file on your computer and listen to the output from the speaker.
